# FPGA-implementation-of-FIR-and-IIR
This project demonstrates the design, simulation, and FPGA implementation of FIR and IIR digital filters for real-time signal processing. These filters are applied to denoise biomedical (ECG), audio, and sine wave signals. Both filters are designed using MATLAB/Python for coefficient generation and implemented in SystemVerilog.
